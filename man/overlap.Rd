\title{Generate a connectivity matrix based on euclidean distance between points}
\usage{
overlap(output.neurons, input.neurons, delta = 1, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{output.neurons}{first set of neurons}

\item{input.neurons}{second set of neurons}

\item{delta}{the distance (in um) at which a synapse might occur}

\item{progress}{whether or not to have a progress bar}
}
\value{
a matrix of overlap scores
}
\description{
Generates an 'overlap matrix' of overlap scores between neurons in the \code{output.neurons} and \code{input.neurons} pools.
For every point in a given neuron in \code{output.neurons}, a distance score is calculated to every point in a neuron in \code{input.neurons}.
The sum of this score is added to the final output matrix. The score is calculated as \code{e(-d^2/2δ^2)}, where d is the euclidean distance between the two points,
and δ is the expected distance in um that is considered 'close'. It is recommended that the user resamples neurons before use, using \code{\link{resample}}.
